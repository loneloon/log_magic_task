## Solution Overview

Using the provided source i have attempted to implement a sufficient solution.

Core features are located in src/crateAllocator.ts
It implements the following classes:
    - CratePrototype class:
        It's main purpose is to simulate a given container and fit all the given items,
        allocating new clusters of empty leftover space after each fit.

    - CratePacker:
        Using provided container specs, product lists and CratePrototype
        fits items and creates container batches which are returned to the orderHandler.

I have also updated packOrder method of OrderHandler class as was intended,
using imported classes from crateAllocator module.
